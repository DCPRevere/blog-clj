* blog-clj
=blog-clj= hosts a blog sourced from [[http://orgmode.org/][org]] files a git repository.
** User experience
All that is needed to publish a new post is to add an org file to the git repo and push it to a remote repository. The application pulls from the git remote and will then serve it, rendered into HTML.
** Required org file structure
The file must start with three required entries:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+TITLE: On practical Event Sourcing in Clojure
#+ID: event-sourcing-clj
#+DATE: 2017/09/11
#+END_SRC
** Future development
I will be making the changes necessary for this to be used by other people.
